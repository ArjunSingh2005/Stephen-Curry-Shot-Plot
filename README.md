# Stephen-Curry-Shot-Plot
Stephen Curry Shot Plot by Arjun Singh üèÄ
This project visualizes Stephen Curry's career shot data on a half-court background using Streamlit and Plotly. It allows users to filter shots based on seasons, quarters, shot types, time remaining, and whether the shot was made or missed. The app dynamically updates the visualization based on the filters applied.

Example Data
The shot data should be structured as follows in your CSV file:
Season,X_Loc,Y_Loc,Quarter,Time,Shot Type,Made
2009-2010,33.9,29.9,1st quarter,11:25.0,3-pointer,False
2009-2010,11.8,19.5,1st quarter,9:31.0,2-pointer,True
...
